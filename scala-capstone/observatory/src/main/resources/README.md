To prepare the timeusage dataset, change to the directory where this README.md file lives and execute the following command:
`wget http://alaska.epfl.ch/files/scala-capstone-data.zip`
Then unzip the archive.
`unzip -j scala-capstone-data.zip`
You will need the .csv files be located under the “observatory/src/main/resources/” directory, thus do not forget the `-j` switch above.
